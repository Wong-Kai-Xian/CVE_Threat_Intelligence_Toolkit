# CVE-Intel
## Purpose

CVE-Intel is a tool designed to provide security analysts with all the essential details needed to reconstruct and thoroughly understand a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). It consolidates critical information to enable deeper insight into each vulnerability, facilitating more effective analysis and response.

Key features include:

- Detailed CVE information including descriptions, proof-of-concept (PoC) code, prerequisite environment data such as build numbers, and related MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
- Quick download of the necessary environment components to facilitate realistic simulation of the CVE exploit.
- LLM-based behavior extraction that analyzes input data like Process Monitor (Procmon) logs to identify key behaviors associated with the CVE.
- Provides low-level context on exploit behavior, helping analysts gain a nuanced understanding of the attack techniques involved.

By combining these features, CVE-Intel empowers analysts to simulate, analyze, and better defend against software vulnerabilities with enhanced precision and context.
