# CVE-Intel
## Purpose

CVE-Intel is a tool designed to provide security analysts with all the essential details needed to reconstruct and thoroughly understand a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures). It consolidates critical information to enable deeper insight into each vulnerability, facilitating more effective analysis and response.

Key features include:

- **Detailed CVE Information:**  
  Provides comprehensive descriptions, proof-of-concept (PoC) code, prerequisite environment details such as build numbers, and maps related MITRE ATT&CK techniques to give analysts a full picture of the vulnerability and its exploit context.

- **Quick Environment Setup:**  
  Enables rapid download of required environment components, allowing users to efficiently set up realistic conditions for simulating the CVE exploit.

- **LLM-Based Behavior Extraction:**  
  Uses large language models to analyze input data such as Process Monitor (Procmon) logs, extracting key behaviors related to the CVE to highlight important exploit patterns.

- **Low-Level Contextual Analysis:**  
  Provides in-depth, low-level insights into exploit behavior, helping analysts gain a nuanced understanding of attacker techniques and improve detection strategies.

By combining these features, CVE-Intel empowers analysts to simulate, analyze, and better defend against software vulnerabilities with enhanced precision and context.
