The vulnerability lies in the Win32k driver, specifically in the NtGdiResetDC function, due to improper handling of user-mode callbacks. This vulnerability has been exploited by threat actors to gain elevated privileges on Windows servers. Attackers leveraged this flaw to execute arbitrary kernel commands, allowing them to manipulate system processes and deploy additional malware to perform further malicious activities.

The exploit in question is actively being used in the wild, primarily in espionage campaigns. It involves triggering a use-after-free condition by executing the ResetDC function a second time for the same handle during a callback.

The ransomware further erases system logs and may publish stolen data on leak websites, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential installation of backdoors for further exploitation. Microsoft addressed this vulnerability in their security updates by introducing measures to make file paths unpredictable, thereby mitigating the exploit chain. Despite these updates, additional vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office and Windows were identified. Security solutions offer protection against these exploits, and findings are shared with cybersecurity alliances to enhance collective defense efforts.

This vulnerability has been exploited by the Russian group Storm-0978, also known as RomCom, who craft specially designed Microsoft Office documents related to the Ukrainian World Congress. These documents bypass Microsoft's Mark-of-the-Web (MotW) security feature, enabling remote code execution without security prompts. The adversary used phishing techniques to deliver these documents, enticing victims to open them. Once opened, the ransomware, known as Underground, executes, encrypting files and demanding a ransom for decryption.

The ransomware further removes shadow copies, terminates MS SQL Server services, and leaves a ransom note threatening data loss if recovery is attempted without their decryptor key. It also erases Windows Event logs and publishes stolen victim data on a data leak website, causing unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential installation of backdoors for further exploitation.",,09/10/2024,02/11/2025
